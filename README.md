## Getting Started 🚀

To use the User Card React Component V2, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone `<repository-url>`


2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd `user-card`


3. Install the project dependencies using a package manager like npm or yarn:

`npm install` or `yarn install`


4. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the user card component. 😎👍

## Customizing the User Card ✨

To customize the user card component to display different user information or modify its styling, you need to make changes to the `index.js` file located in the `src/` directory.

Within the `index.js` file, you will find the code for the user card component implemented using class components. Modify the component's logic and appearance according to your requirements. As the styling is embedded within the HTML file, you can modify the inline styles directly in the `index.html` file located in the `public/` directory.
